# AFL Stats Tracker - Interview Summary

## Quick Project Overview (30 seconds)
"I developed an Android app called AFL Stats Tracker that allows users to record real-time statistics during Australian Football League matches. The app uses Kotlin and Firebase to track player actions like kicks, goals, and tackles, with features for team setup, live match recording, and historical data analysis."

## Key Technical Achievements

### 1. **Modern Android Development**
- **Kotlin**: Full Kotlin implementation with modern language features
- **View Binding**: Type-safe view references for better performance
- **RecyclerView**: Efficient list management for player and match data
- **Parcelable**: Efficient data transfer between activities

### 2. **Firebase Integration**
- **Firestore**: NoSQL database for real-time data synchronization
- **Real-time Updates**: Live statistics tracking during matches
- **Data Structure**: Hierarchical document organization
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive failure management and recovery

### 3. **Complex UI/UX Design**
- **Multi-Activity Navigation**: 7 different activities with data flow
- **Image Handling**: Camera and gallery integration for team logos
- **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate visual confirmation of actions
- **AFL Theming**: Authentic sports app design

### 4. **Data Management**
- **Real-time Statistics**: Live tracking of 6 different player actions
- **Score Calculation**: Automatic goal/behind scoring (6 points/1 point)
- **Quarter Management**: 4-quarter match structure
- **Undo Functionality**: Data integrity with action reversal

## Technical Challenges Solved

### 1. **Data Consistency Problem**
**Challenge**: Ensuring data integrity when users undo actions in a real-time system
**Solution**: Implemented a comprehensive undo system that tracks the last action, reverses both local state and Firebase data, and maintains score consistency

### 2. **Performance Optimization**
**Challenge**: Handling large datasets of player statistics efficiently
**Solution**: Used RecyclerView with custom adapters, implemented lazy loading, and optimized Firebase queries

### 3. **Complex State Management**
**Challenge**: Managing state across multiple activities with different data types
**Solution**: Used Parcelable objects for data transfer, implemented proper activity lifecycle management, and maintained consistent data flow

## Code Quality Highlights

### 1. **Clean Architecture**
- Separation of concerns with dedicated data models
- MVVM pattern implementation
- Proper activity lifecycle management

### 2. **Error Handling**
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful degradation for network failures

### 3. **Code Organization**
- Logical file structure
- Consistent naming conventions
- Comprehensive documentation

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Match Creation Workflow**
- Team name input and logo upload
- Player management (add/edit/delete)
- Validation for minimum player requirements

### 2. **Real-Time Statistics Tracking**
- 6 different player actions (Kick, Handball, Mark, Tackle, Goal, Behind)
- Live score calculation and display
- Quarter-by-quarter tracking

### 3. **Data Persistence**
- Firebase Firestore integration
- Match history with chronological listing
- Player statistics across multiple matches

### 4. **User Experience**
- Intuitive navigation flow
- Real-time visual feedback
- Professional AFL-themed design

## Technical Stack Details

### **Frontend**
- **Language**: Kotlin
- **Platform**: Android (API 24+)
- **UI Framework**: Android Views with RecyclerView
- **Architecture**: MVVM with View Binding

### **Backend**
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore (NoSQL)
- **Authentication**: Firebase (configured)
- **Storage**: Firebase Storage for images
- **Real-time**: Firestore real-time listeners

### **Development Tools**
- **IDE**: Android Studio
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Build System**: Gradle
- **Testing**: Android JUnit

## Interview Questions You Can Answer

### **"Tell me about a challenging technical problem you solved"**
"I implemented an undo system for real-time statistics tracking. The challenge was maintaining data consistency between local state and Firebase when users undo actions. I solved this by tracking the last action's metadata, implementing reverse operations for both local state and database, and ensuring score calculations remain accurate."

### **"How did you handle performance optimization?"**
"I used RecyclerView for efficient list rendering, implemented lazy loading for large datasets, and optimized Firebase queries by structuring data hierarchically. I also used View Binding for compile-time view references and implemented proper activity lifecycle management."

### **"Describe your database design"**
"I designed a hierarchical Firestore structure with matches as top-level documents containing team info, timestamps, and player statistics. Each match has a subcollection of actions for real-time tracking. This structure allows efficient querying and real-time updates while maintaining data consistency."

### **"How did you ensure code quality?"**
"I followed Kotlin best practices, implemented proper error handling, used meaningful variable names, and organized code into logical modules. I also used Parcelable for type-safe data transfer and implemented comprehensive validation for user inputs."
